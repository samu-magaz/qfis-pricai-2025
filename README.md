# Implementing Quantum Fuzzy Inference Systems for the Detection of Apneic Events - Code

Repository for the paper "Implementing Quantum Fuzzy Inference Systems for the Detection of Apneic Events" presented in PRICAI 2025 - Workshop on Quantum Computing for Search and Optimization Problems

In this repository, you will find the implementation of the experiments presented in Section 3 of the paper.

## Classical FIS

To test the classical implementation, MATLAB's Fuzzy Logic Designer is required. Once the software is ready, simply import the file ```fis-sao2.fis``` and test as desired.
